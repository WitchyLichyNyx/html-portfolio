<h1>The best movies according to Nyx</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ghost in the Shell 1995</h3>
<p>It had a lot of dry phylosophy about what it means to be human and the self, all with a very cool cyber-noire setting</p>
<h3>The Banshees of Inisherin</h3>
<p>A great mix of comedy and drama with characters slowly descending into darkness</p>
<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>The animation and designs were so astounding they lodged itself into my mind for my entire life</p>
